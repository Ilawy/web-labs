                    One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he
                    found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
                    He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a
                    little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and
                    divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was
                    hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any
                    moment. His many legs.
