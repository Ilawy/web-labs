## Q2 Difference between:
- `b` and `strong`  
both of them have the same functionality, the difference is in the meaining (usualy related to accessability). so `b` just make the text bold, while `strong` mark it as important

- `i` and `em`  
same thing goes here, `i` will make it italic, while `em` emphasize the content

and so on
